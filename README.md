skit is a simple Slackbot Kit for Go (or `Golang`). Skit pre-compiled
binary is good enough to build simple slack bots. For more complex usecases
skit can be used as a library as well.


## Installation

Simply download the pre-built binary for your platform from the
[Releases](https://github.com/spy16/skit/releases) section.
